# dwaf

dwaf (dredteam WAF) is a modern HTTP Web Application Firewall that acts as a reverse proxy; dwaf is written in Go.

‚ùó**dwaf is not ready for use yet and is still in active development phase.**

## Features (planned)

* Updates its signatures in background
* Focuses on blocking requests and not responses
* Uses centralized KV storage (consul) for everything
* Ships in docker

## Limitations by design

* does not support TLS
* does not support acting as an edge HTTP server
* does not support explicit deny (default allow)
